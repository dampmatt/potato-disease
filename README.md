# Potato Disease Detection

This minor college project tackles the issue of potato disease detection using machine learning. By automatically identifying diseases in potato leaf images, this project aims to empower farmers with early detection capabilities, ultimately leading to improved crop health and yield

# Project Goals

To develop a deep learning model to identify common potato diseases like Early Blight and Late Blight.
To assist farmers in early detection of potato diseases, enabling timely intervention and improved crop yield.

# Project Structure
+ **Potato-Disease**: This is the root folder.
+ **Plant Village**:  This folder stores the potato leaf image dataset categorized by disease type (healthy, Early Blight, Late Blight, etc.).
+ **api**: contains code regarding api's used to handle all the requests.
+ **saved_models**: This folder contains the trained machine learning models.
+ **frontend**: T his folder contains the code regarding the frontend of the website for the project.
+ **README.md**: This file (you are reading it now!).
